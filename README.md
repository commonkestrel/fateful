# Fateful
![GitHub Workflow Status (with event)](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/commonkestrel/fateful/rust.yml)

Fateful is a CLI tool foring with my custom CPU, F8ful.
It contains an emulator and an assembler.
Fateful can be installed via [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo): 
```bash 
cargo install --git https://github.com/commonkestrel/fateful
```

Running a program has two steps: assembly and emulation.
To assemble a program, run the `assemble` or `asm` command: 
```bash
fateful assemble <program>.asm -o <program>.bin
```

If this is successful, you can emulate the program with the `emulate` or `emu` command: 
```bash
fateful emulate <program>.bin
```

The emulator is a REPL that contains various commands expalined [below](#emulator).
The most important command for emulating a program is `RUN`.
Inputting `RUN 0` will run the assembly program as fast as possible until a halt is detected.

## Assembler

The assembler can be used with the `fateful asm` or `fateful assemble` command to assemble fateful assembly into f8ful machine code.
The input and output are both optional, and default to `stdin` and `stdout` respectively.
Input is positional, being the first argument, and the output can be specified with the `-o` or `--output` flag.

### Instruction Set

Fateful assembly contains just 16 instructions,
including arithmetic, memory operations, a hardware stack, 
and a `jnz` (Jump if not zero) instruction making the CPU turing complete.

### Labels

Labels help make blocks of your program easily accessible.
They consist of an identifier followed by a colon (`:`).
Labels with an identifier beginning with `.` are considered local to the most recent global label.
Local labels can also be accessed globally via `<parent>.<local>`.

Example:
```asm
parent:
    ; assembly code
.local1:
    jmp [.local1]
.local2:
    jmp [parent.local2]
```

### Preprocessor Directives

There are a variety of C-style preprocessor directives included in the assembler, indicated with a preceding `@`.
These directives can apply conditional transformations to the source before compilation.
Macros are processed in top-down order, meaning if a `@define` is placed below an `@ifdef` in the file, the define will not be in scope during the check.

#### DEFINE

The define macro links an identifier to a group of tokens.
Before compiling, each instance of this identifier is replaced with the specified tokens.

Unlike C, this does not support function-style definitions, meaning no arguments are allowed.

Syntax:
```rs
@define <identifier> <value>
```

#### UNDEF

The `@undef` macro removes (undefines) the current definition of the given identifier.
Consequently, subsequent occurrences of the identifier are ignored by the preprocessor.

Syntax:
```rs
@undef <identifier>
```

#### ERROR

The `@error` directive emits a user-specified error message before terminating the assembly.

Syntax:
```rs
@error "error message"
```

#### IF

The `@if` directive controls compilation of portions of a source file.
If the expression you write after the `@if` is greater than 0, the block following the `@if` is retained for assembly.

Syntax:
```
@if <expr>
    ...
@endif
```

#### ELIF

The `@elif` directive is only allowed as part of an `@if` block,
and is only evaluated if the previously evaluated blocks' check evaluates to 0.
Similar to the `@if` directive, if the expression you write after the `@elif` is greater than 0, the block following the `@elif` is retained for assembly.

Syntax:

```
@if <expr>
    ...
@elif <expr>
    ...
@endif
```

#### ELSE

The `@else` directive is only allowed at the end of an `@if` block.
If the expression of the previously evaluated block's check evaluates to 0,
then the block following the `@else` is retained for assembly.

Syntax:

```
@if <expr>
    ...
@else
    ...
@endif
```

#### IFDEF

The `@ifdef` directive is functionally the same as `@if 1` if the identifier has been defined,
and `@if 0` when the identifier hasn't been defined, or has been undefined by the `@undef` directive.

Syntax:
```
@ifdef <identifier>
    ...
@endif
```

#### IFNDEF

The `@ifndef` directive is functionally the same as `@if 0` if the identifier has been defined,
and `@if 1` when the identifier hasn't been defined, or has been undefined by the `@undef` directive.

Syntax:
```
@ifndef <identifier>
    ...
@endif
```

#### Include

The include macro pastes a stream of tokens from another file.
The file must be located in a package, and can be indexed by filepath relative to the root of the package.

A package is linked to an identifier through a rich comment, and can be either a local directory or a remote git repository.


Syntax:
```rs
/// <package> = <path/git repository>
@include <<package>/<file path>>
```

Example:

```rs
/// error = https://github.com/commonkestrel/f8ful_os
@include <error/error.asm>
```

### Segments

The assembly is divided into segments, specified with the `@cseg` and `@dseg` directives,
and organized by the `@org` directive.
The `@org` directive will apply to the current segment, and can only be specified once per segment.
Segments can be used to organize blocks of data and code throughout the address space.

#### Code Segments

Code segments, signified by the `@cseg` directive,
are where all of your assembly instructions are located.
Each assembly program starts in an initial code segment.

#### Data Segments

Data segments, signified by the `@dseg`,
are a block in RAM rather than the ROM.
These segments allow you to reserve blocks for global variables.
The variables defined in a data segment will reserve a RAM address while automatically avoiding collision.

Variables can be defined with a few directives.
These directives allow reserving blocks of variable size, specified here:
| Directive                  | Size   |
|----------------------------|--------|
| `@byte <identifier>`       | 1      |
| `@double <identifier>`     | 2      |
| `@quad <identifier>`       | 4      |
| `@var <size> <identifier>` | *size* |

These variables will resolve to an address at assembly, and can be accessed via *$identifier*.

#### Organization

Segments are automatically arranged to avoid collision,
but they can be manually organized with the `@org` directive.
This directive will place the origin of a segment at the address specified.
This is especially useful to make sure that the origni of your code is placed at `0x0000`,
since the program starts running from this point.

Unfortunately, manual organization can result in collisions,
so you must be careful to avoid these if manually organizing two or more segments of the same type.

### Data

You can place raw data within the program as well.
This data can be acessed with `lpm`.
Similar to variables in the data segment, these are placed with the following directives:

* `@byte <imm8>`
* `@double <imm16>`
* `@quad <imm32>`
* `@str <string>`

This data is often used in conjunction with a label in order to make it easily locatable.

Example
```c
hello:
    @str "hello world"
```

### Macros

Macros are an incredibly powerful part of this assembler, 
and are defined with the `@macro` directive.
They are similar to C's function-style `#define` macros,
but with optionally typed parameters and multiple definitions for different parameters.

Each parameter can have an accepted type, or multiple accepted types with the `|` operator.
Parameter identifiers must begin with a `%`.
These types are listed here:

* `reg`: Matches a register input (A, B, C, D, E, F, H, L)
* `imm`: Matches an immediate integer
* `addr`: Matches a RAM address
* `label`: Matches a ROM address
* `ident`: Matches any identifier
* `str`: Matches a string literal
* `any`: Matches any of the previous

Syntax:
```asm
; This syntax defines a singular signiture
@macro <identifier> (<parameters>) {
    ; assembly code
}

; This syntax allows for the definition of multiple signitures
@macro <identifier> {
    (<parameters>) {

    }

    (<parameters>) {

    }
}
```

This may be a little confusing, so we can use an example from the built-in macros (we'll get to these later):

```asm
@macro jmp {
    () {
        jnz 1
    }
    (%location:label) {
        lda %location
        jmp
    }
}
```

What are we even looking at here?
Well, this macro contains two signitures - 
one with an empty parameter list and one with a ROM address bound to the `%location` parameter.
As you can see, the second signiture contains another `jmp` instruction,
showcasing the fact that these macros are evaluated recursively.

Macros are used just like normal instructions.
For example, the `jmp` macro can be used like `jmp [foo]`,
which expands to this:

```asm
lda [foo]
jnz 1
```

## Emulator

The f8ful emulator simulates each individual clock cycle,
using the CPU's microcode to determine what to do on each pulse.
An upside to this is that you can dump the CPU at any time and see the microcode and program counter for each clock pulse.
A downside, however, is that the emulator is much slower than it could be,
since it has to check every microcode flag for every clock pulse.

The emulator contains a REPL with a few useful commands:

* [SET](#set)
* [GET](#get)
* [PEEK](#peek)
* [POKE](#poke)
* [RUN](#RUN)
* [LOAD](#load)
* [DROP](#drop)
* [DUMP](#dump)
* [STEP](#step)
* [RESET](#reset)
* [STOP](#stop)
* [QUIT](#quit)
* [HELP](#help)

### SET

Syntax: `SET <register>, <value>`

Sets the value of *register* to *value*.

### GET

Syntax: `GET <register>`

Prints the data stored in *register*.

### PEEK

Syntax: `PEEK <address>`

Prints the data stored in memory at *address*.

### POKE

Syntax: `POKE <address>, <value>`

Sets the memory at *address* to *value*.

### RUN

Syntax: `RUN <speed>`

Runs the emulator clock at *speed* in HZ.
If *speed* is zero the emulator clock will run uncapped.

### LOAD

Syntax: `LOAD <path>, <address>`

Attaches the [peripheral](#peripherals) located at *path* to *address*.

### DROP

Syntax: `DROP <address>`

Drops the [peripheral](#peripherals) attached to *address* if there is one.

### DUMP

Syntax: `DUMP`

Prints the current machine state.
Includes information such as the program counter,
stack pointer, status register, ALU registers,
general purpose registers, etc...

### STEP

Syntax: `STEP`

Steps the emulator clock by one pulse.
Only works if the emulator clock is stopped.

### RESET

Syntax: `RESET`

Resets the CPU state to the initial state.

### STOP

Syntax: `STOP`

Stops the emulator clock.
Only works if the emulator clock is running.

### QUIT

Syntax: `QUIT`

Drops all peripherals and quits the emulator.

### HELP

Syntax: `HELP`

Prints a help message detailing the REPL's commands.

### MMIO

There are several locations in memory with mapped IO.
These memory-mapped addresses allow programs to interact with hardware directly.
The top 48 memory addresses are reserved for various peripherals,
with two implemented in the emulator.

 * `0xFFFF` is where the status register (SREG) resides.
 * `0xFFFE` is the low byte of the stack pointer.
 * `0xFFFD` is the high byte of the stack pointer.

Below these reserved addresses, the address range `0xF000` through `0xFFCF` are reserved for the video memory.
This address range is functionally similar to VGA text mode in x86 processors,
with an 85x20 character screen.

The low (character) byte is the code point.
The VGA text follows code-page 737 seen below:

![Code-page 737](./misc/characters.png)

The second byte is the attribute or modifier byte,
describing the foreground and background colors.
The lower nibble describes the foreground color,
while the upper nibble describes the background color.

![An example of all foreground and background colors](./misc/colors.png)
*<sub>An example of all foreground and background colors</sub>*

## Tests

Fateful has a built-in test suite that can make it easy to make sure
your program actually does what it is supposed to.
You can run tests on assembly programs with the `test` command:
```bash
fateful test <program>.asm
```

The test command will check the contents of registers after halting if specified in the program.
These checks are specified in rich comments (`///`) similar to libraries.
For example, these are the checks included in the `fib.asm` example:
```rust
/// a: 0x0D
/// b: 0x15
/// c: 0x00
/// d: 0x15
```

These are only read by the test suite, and will be checked after the emulator halts.
In this example, the test-runner will assert that the content of the A register is `0x0D`,
the B register is `0x15`, the C register is `0x00`, and the D register is `0x15`.
If these assertions fail, the test is marked as failing.

The test command also includes a `--timeout` flag, which defaults to `500ms`.
If the emulator does not detect a halt in this time,
the emulator will exit and the test will be marked as failing.

## Peripherals

Peripherals are a way to extend the emulator,
simulating a memory-mapped peripheral.
This is done through the use of dynamic library loading,
so you can create a peripheral in any language that supports the C ABI.
Peripherals can be attached to one or more slots in the top 48 bytes of RAM.

### Stateless Peripherals

Stateless peripherals are the simplest form of peripheral,
with state being managed by the peripheral rather than the emulator.

#### Initialization

Stateless peripherals are initialized by a function with the signiture `int init(unsigned char)`.
The return value of this is expalined in [errors](#errors).
The input parameter provides the number of slots that the peripheral has been attached to.

#### Reading and Writing

Peripherals can be written through a function with the signiture `void write(unsigned char, unsigned char)`.
This function is called whenever the CPU writes to the given address or the address is `POKE`ed.
The first parameter is the slot index that is being written to, and the second parameter is the value being written.

Peripherals can be read from with a function with the signiture `unsigned char read(unsigned char)`.
This function is called whenever the CPU reads from the given address or the address is `PEEK`ed at.
The input parameter is the slot index that is being read from, and the return value should be the value at the slot.

#### Drop

Peripherals are dropped through a function with the signiture `void drop()`.
This function is called when every address this peripheral is attached to is `DROP`ed, or the emulator is quit.
This function *must* clean up any seperate threads before returning or the emulator will crash.

#### Reset

Peripherals are reset through a function with the signiture `void reset()`.
This functions is called whenever the emulator resets the CPU.

### Stateful Peripherals

Stateful peripherals are a way to offload managing state to the emulator.
They essentially allow a peripheral to hand off a heap-allocated pointer to that peripheral's state.
This is especially important if you are spawning multiple threads and need to rejoin the main thread,
or if you want to have multiple instances of the same peripheral.

There is a Rust crate - [`fateful_peripheral`](https://github.com/commonkestrel/fateful_peripheral) -
that handles all of the pointer magic behind the scenes, allowing you to stay completely in the `safe` world.

#### Initialization

When a stateful peripheral is initialized through a function of the signiture `*void stateful_init(char)`,
it must return a pointer to the state's location.
**Warning:** This pointer *must* be stored on the heap,
otherwise the emulator *will* Segfault.
Other than the pointer return,
the rest of the function should be the same as its stateless counterpart.

If an error occurs during the setup,
the process for reporting these is explained in [Errors](#errors).

#### Reads, Writes, Drops, and Resets

Reading, writing, dropping, and resetting stateful peripherals is functionally the same as stateless,
but each function has an extra `stateless_` prepended to its identifier,
as well as a pointer parameter (`*void`) at the start of each functions's parameters.

### Errors

Errors are only checked upon initialization - after both `init` and `stateful_init`.
If either `init` returns a non-zero value or `stateful_init` returns a null pointer,
the emulator will check for a function with the signiture `int last_error_length()`.
If this function exists, the emulator will then check for a function with the signiture `*char last_error()`.
`last_error_length` should return the length of the ASCII string pointed to by the result of `last_error`.

### Names

Peripherals can optionally have a name that will displayed when the emulator is `DUMP`ed.
This must be supplied by a function with the following signiture: `*char name()`.
The returned pointer must point to a null-terminated ASCII string.
